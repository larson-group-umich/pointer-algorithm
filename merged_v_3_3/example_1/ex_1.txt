This example input file can be used to generate the bottom set of pointer algorithm curves in Figure 1 of ref. 1.  The other pointer algorithm curves can also be generated by changing the value of zeta (the second input in line 9) from 0.01 to either 0.1 or 1.  Note that in Figure 1 these curves were shifted upwards by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude for readability.

The input file is set up to run a non-iterative pointer algorithm simulaton with the following parameters:
T = 300 K
phi (volume fraction) = 0.01
eta_s (solvent viscosity) = 0.00085 Pa.s
l_p = 20 nm
<L> = 2.52 um
d = 4 nm
zeta = 0.01
alpha = 14

As written, this simulation includes bending modes, which were excluded in Figure 1 for comparison with the slip-spring simulations.  To remove the bending modes, they can either be subtracted out manually using the output file bending.dat or not included in the simulation by changing the value of LBEND from 1 to 0 in line 89 of the simulation code.

Also provided with this example simulation are sample output files, one including bending modes and one with bending modes subtracted, and a reproduction of Figure 1 from ref. 1, with the pointer algorithm curves generated by the example simulation here shown in red.
